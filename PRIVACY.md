# **Paper & Refract Privacy Policy**  
_Last updated: April 29, 2025_

At **The Refract Co.**, we care about your privacy. This policy explains what we collect, why, and how it’s handled — in plain English, no legalese.

### Accounts and Sync  
Right now, all your data in **Paper** (your library, settings, etc.) stays entirely on your device. In a future version, we’ll introduce optional cloud syncing using **Firebase**, to let you access your books and settings across devices.

When this update happens, you’ll get a clear notification in the app. We won’t move anything to the cloud unless you agree.

We’ll use **Firebase Auth** to help you log in and **Firebase Firestore/Storage** to sync your content securely.

### Analytics (optional) 
Analytics are entirely optional and possible to disable at any time. 
We use **PostHog** to understand how people use the app — like which features are popular or which screens are used most often. This helps us improve the experience.

We only collect **anonymous, non-identifiable information**. No file names or content, no personal data. We don't know what you read and we won't try to find out.

### Crash Reporting  
To fix bugs quickly, we use **Sentry** to log crash reports and app errors. These reports may include technical details about what caused the crash but **do not** contain your personal files or identity.

### Platform data collection
If you're on **Windows**, Microsoft might also collect crash reports separately via Windows Error Reporting (which is built into Windows). You can turn it off in your own **Windows privacy settings**.

### Your Control  
You can use Paper completely offline. No accounts or analytics are required.

When we do introduce new features like cloud sync or login, they’ll be optional and explained clearly before you choose to use them.

We don’t sell your data. We don’t track you.  
We only collect what we need to improve Paper — and we always want you to know what’s going on.

### Your rights
We follow the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) even if you’re not in the EU. We believe privacy is a right — everywhere. That means:
- We only collect data when it’s necessary and explained.
- You can ask to see, delete, or correct your data.
- We don’t use your data for ads or sell it to anyone.

If you ever have questions or want to make a request, you can reach us directly at [mailto:privacy@refract.fyi](privacy@refract.fyi).
